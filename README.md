# RocHack server configuration

## Purpose

If you are a RocHack member, you can make a pull request here to ask for
something to be set up on the server that requires configuration.

Even if you are not a RocHack member, maybe you will find this useful if you
want to learn something about how we configure our services.

## Services

- nginx web server
- IRC bots

## Notes

If a config file has passwords, private keys, or other sensitive data in it,
either omit the file, or rename it and remove the sensitive data.
